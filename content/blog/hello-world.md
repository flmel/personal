There we go! My first blog post ever.

I've wanted to do this for a while, but I finally had the courage to go for it. I'm not quite sure why I put it off for so long. Perhaps it was due to imposter syndrome, procrastination, or self-doubt â€“ things we all face to some degree.

What do I hope to achieve with this blog?

- Develop the habit of writing
- Improve my language skills as a non-native speaker
- Share my understandings, findings, and skills to help my future self and hopefully others
- Maybe even overcome my long-term commitment issues... just kidding... not kidding...

What do I want to blog about?

Programming, technology, personal musings, and adventures. As you'll probably notice (if I manage to keep up with this blog) I have a wide range of interests.

That's all for now, *"start small"*.
